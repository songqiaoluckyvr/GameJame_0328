#### Assistant
Created Journey.md to document our development process and interactions, including timestamps, prompts, and key decisions (this document).

#### User
> perfect, don't forget to update this doc in the later interactions between us, mate

#### Assistant
Acknowledged the request to maintain documentation of our interactions in Journey.md and committed to updating it with all future exchanges.

#### User
> tell me what I just added in the scene

#### Assistant
Checked the scene and found that a new "Sphere" object has been added to the SampleScene, which now contains:
- Main Camera
- Directional Light
- Sphere (newly added)

#### User
> help me setup the git repo for this project

#### Assistant
Set up Git repository with the following steps:
1. Created `.gitignore` file with Unity-specific patterns
2. Initialized Git repository with `git init`
3. Renamed default branch to 'main'
4. Added all files to staging
5. Created initial commit with project setup and folder structure

The repository is now ready for version control with appropriate Unity-specific ignore patterns in place.

#### User
> lets push the repo to remote

#### Assistant
Successfully set up remote repository and pushed our code:
1. Added remote origin: https://github.com/songqiaoluckyvr/GameJame_0328

> Let's focus on player control first, since we decide it will be a 2.5d game which player will just move left and right and jump, so the control would be "A" move left, 'D' move right and "Space" jump. clear up the previous implementation and update with this request

#### Assistant
Simplified the PlayerMovement script to focus on essential 2.5D controls:

1. **Movement Controls**
   - A/D or Left/Right arrows for horizontal movement
