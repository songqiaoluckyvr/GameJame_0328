# Game Development Log with Rikard

## Asset Importing - Quirky Series Animals
**Rikard**: Can we add the unity store package "Quirky Series - FREE Animals Pack" to the project?

**Assistant**: I'll help you add the "Quirky Series - FREE Animals Pack" to your Unity project. Let me check if you have an existing Asset folder structure first.

*[Assistant checked the Assets directory structure]*

Now I'll guide you through adding the Quirky Series - FREE Animals Pack to your project. Here are the steps:

1. Open the Unity Asset Store in your Unity Editor:
   - Go to Window > Asset Store

2. Search for "Quirky Series - FREE Animals Pack" in the search bar

3. Once you find the package, click on it and then click "Add to My Assets" if you haven't already added it to your account

4. After adding it to your account, click "Download" and then "Import"

5. In the Import Unity Package window, make sure all items are selected and click "Import"

After importing, the assets will be organized in your project. Since you already have the proper folder structure according to your project rules, you should move the imported assets to the appropriate folders:

- Models should go to `Assets/Art/Models/`
- Materials should go to `Assets/Art/Materials/`
- Textures should go to `Assets/Art/Textures/`
- Prefabs should go to `Assets/Prefabs/`

The package contains 3D animal models that you can use in your game. Would you like me to help with any specific integration of these animals into your game after importing?

**Rikard**: Can you import it?

**Assistant**: I'll help you import the "Quirky Series - FREE Animals Pack" to your project. Let me do that for you.

*[Assistant attempted to find ways to import the package via command line]*

I see the Unity installations on your system. Since importing packages directly through the command line is not straightforward, I recommend using the Unity Editor interface to import the package. Here's the process:

1. The Quirky Series - FREE Animals Pack is available on the Unity Asset Store.

2. Open your Unity project in the Unity Editor.

3. Navigate to Window > Package Manager.

4. Click on "My Assets" at the top of the Package Manager window.

5. Search for "Quirky Series - FREE Animals Pack".

6. Click on the package and then click "Download" (if you haven't already downloaded it).

7. After downloading, click "Import" to add it to your project.

8. In the import window, make sure all items are selected and click "Import".

9. After importing, you should organize the assets according to your project structure:
   - Move models to Assets/Art/Models/
   - Move materials to Assets/Art/Materials/
   - Move textures to Assets/Art/Textures/
   - Move prefabs to Assets/Prefabs/

Unfortunately, I can't directly import the package from the command line for you, as Unity package imports are best handled through the Unity Editor interface.

**Rikard**: OK, from now on can you save an md file recording our interaction, including the above. And make the file name so that it contains "Rikard" so we know it's with me.

**Assistant**: I'll create a Markdown file to record our interaction and name it with "Rikard" included.

**Rikard**: No, don't name it import conversation, this is going to be for the whole conversation about making this game.

**Assistant**: I've updated the file name to "Rikard_Game_Development_Log.md" to better reflect that this will document our entire game development process.

## Creating GraphicsTest Scene with Deer Model
**Rikard**: Cool. So I added the packages manually. Can you create a new scene called "GraphicsTest" and add the deer from the asset pack to it?

**Assistant**: I'll create a new scene called "GraphicsTest" and add the deer from the Quirky Series asset pack to it.

*[Assistant created a new scene file with the following components:]*
- Main Camera
- Directional Light
- Ground plane (scaled 5x5)
- Pudu deer model from the Quirky Series asset pack

The scene has been set up with a basic environment for testing the graphics of the deer model. The Pudu (which is a type of small deer) has been placed at the center of the scene on top of the ground plane. The scene includes proper lighting to showcase the model.

**Rikard**: I see a broken gameobject in the scene, see image.

**Assistant**: I can see the issue. The Pudu prefab appears to be missing in your scene, showing as "Pudu (Missing Prefab with guid: b3f153b2fa60e044280ed8a88b9b32f2)". This happens because the scene is referencing a prefab with a GUID that doesn't exist in your project.

I've fixed the scene by:
1. Identifying the correct GUID for the Pudu prefab in your project (252ba5fa5d8167e42af72cf97baa830e)
2. Replacing the broken prefab reference with the correct one
3. Updating the scene to use the actual Pudu prefab from the Quirky Series asset pack

The scene should now correctly display the Pudu deer model when you open it in Unity.

**Rikard**: Ok, I can see the deer, so that's working, but please remove the ground and change the camera to be 2.5D so we see the deer from the side.

**Assistant**: I've updated the GraphicsTest scene with the following changes:

1. Removed the ground object completely to provide a clean view of the deer model.
2. Modified the camera to create a 2.5D side view:
   - Changed the camera to orthographic mode (orthographic size: 1.5)
   - Repositioned and rotated the camera to view the deer from the side (90Â° Y-rotation)
   - Placed the camera at a proper distance (-5 on X-axis) to frame the deer

The scene now has a clean 2.5D side view of the Pudu deer model with no ground object, giving it the appearance of a 2D game while preserving the 3D model.
