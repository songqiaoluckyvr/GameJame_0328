# Game Development Journey: 2.5D Infinite Runner

## 1. Project Inception and Setup

### Initial Concept
**User Prompt**: "Let's create a 2.5D infinite runner game where the player needs to collect antidotes to maintain health while running forward."

**Assistant Response**: "I'll help set up the core systems needed for a 2.5D runner. We'll need:
1. Player movement and health systems
2. Camera following in 2.5D space
3. Infinite map generation
4. Collectible system for antidotes
Let's start with the basic player controller and health system."

## 2. Core Systems Development

### 2.1 Player Movement System
**User Prompt**: "We need smooth player movement with jumping ability, and the character should face the direction it's moving."

**Implementation**:
```csharp
public class PlayerMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private float _moveSpeed = 7f;
    [SerializeField] private float _jumpForce = 12f;
    private bool _isFacingRight = true;
    private bool _isGrounded;
    
    private void Update()
    {
        float horizontalInput = Input.GetAxisRaw("Horizontal");
        // Movement and jump logic
        UpdateFacing(horizontalInput);
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Health System Foundation
**User Prompt**: "The player's health should constantly drain over time, and they need to collect antidotes to survive."

**Implementation**:
```csharp
public class PlayerHealth : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private float _maxHealth = 100f;
    [SerializeField] private float _healthDrainRate = 5f;
    
    public event Action OnHealthDepleted;
    public event Action<float, float> OnHealthChanged;
    
    private void Update()
    {
        if (!_isDead)
        {
            DrainHealth();
        }
    }
}
```

### 2.3 Animation System Integration
**User Prompt**: "We need to integrate basic animations for the deer character - idle, run, and jump."

**Implementation**:
```csharp
public class DeerAnimationAndSoundController : MonoBehaviour
{
    private const string ANIM_IDLE = "Idle";
    private const string ANIM_RUN = "Run";
    private const string ANIM_JUMP = "Jump";
    
    private Animator _animator;
    private AudioSource _audioSource;
    
    public void SetIdle()
    {
        PlayAnimation(ANIM_IDLE);
    }
    
    public void Run(float speed)
    {
        PlayAnimation(ANIM_RUN);
        _animator.speed = speed;
    }
}
```

## 3. System Refinements and Enhancements

### 3.1 Health Bar Improvement
**User Prompt**: "Please simplify the interaction with the health bar. The health bar width should change based on the player's current health, with a scale from 100 to 0 health corresponding to a width from 300 to 0 pixels (3:1 ratio)."

**Implementation**:
```csharp
public class HealthBar : MonoBehaviour
{
    private const float HEALTH_TO_WIDTH_RATIO = 3f;
    
    private void UpdateHealthBar(float currentHealth, float maxHealth)
    {
        float width = currentHealth * HEALTH_TO_WIDTH_RATIO;
        _healthFill.sizeDelta = new Vector2(width, _healthFill.sizeDelta.y);
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Debug Features Addition
**User Prompt**: "Add a debug function that allows pressing the 0 key to add 10 health to the player, ensuring that the player's max health does not exceed 100."

**Implementation**:
```csharp
private void Update()
{
    if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Alpha0) || Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Keypad0))
    {
        ModifyHealth(10f);
        if (_debugMode)
        {
            Debug.Log($"[PlayerHealth] Added 10 health. Current health: {_currentHealth}");
        }
    }
}
```

## 4. Advanced Features Implementation

### 4.1 Camera System Evolution
**Initial Implementation**: Complex Cinemachine setup
**User Prompt**: "Let's simplify the camera system by removing the Cinemachine logic"

**Final Implementation**:
```csharp
public class CameraController : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void LateUpdate()
    {
        Vector3 targetPosition = new Vector3(
            _target.position.x,
            transform.position.y,
            transform.position.z
        );
        transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(transform.position, targetPosition, _smoothSpeed);
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Map Generation System
**User Prompt**: "Remove the start tile from the pool after the player moves out and spawn the end tile after the player has moved forward after 10 tile rotations"

**Implementation**:
```csharp
public class MapManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    private int _tileRotationCount = 0;
    private bool _hasRemovedStartTile = false;
    private bool _hasSpawnedEndTile = false;

    private void HandleTileRotation()
    {
        _tileRotationCount++;
        if (_tileRotationCount >= 10 && !_hasSpawnedEndTile)
        {
            SpawnEndTile();
            _hasSpawnedEndTile = true;
        }
    }
}
```

### 4.3 Antidote System
**User Prompt**: "Please generate the antidote in a random range in front or behind player, not right above"

**Implementation**:
```csharp
private void SpawnAntidote()
{
    float randomOffset = Random.Range(_minSpawnDistance, _maxSpawnDistance);
    float spawnX = _playerTransform.position.x + randomOffset;
    Vector3 spawnPosition = new Vector3(spawnX, _spawnHeight, 5f);
    // Spawn antidote at calculated position
}
```

## 5. Technical Challenges Overcome

### Animation State Management
- **Challenge**: Initial animations were stuck on first frame
- **Solution**: Implemented proper state tracking with `_isRunning` flag

### Collision Detection
- **Challenge**: Double collision handling between Antidote and PlayerHealth
- **Solution**: Centralized collision handling in Antidote script

### Minor Challenges Addressed
- Fine-tuning animation speeds and transitions
- Adjusting spawn distances and intervals
- Debug logging improvements
- Tag and trigger collider management

## 6. Final Implementation Features

### Core Mechanics
- Smooth player movement and jumping
- Health management with drain over time
- Antidote collection for health restoration
- Death sequence with animation

### Environment
- Infinite runner style map generation
- Dynamic tile recycling
- Progress-based end tile spawning
- 2.5D perspective maintenance

### Technical Architecture
- Event-driven system architecture
- Component-based design
- Comprehensive debug systems
- Performance-optimized systems

## 7. Future Improvements
- Enhanced visual feedback for health changes
- More varied tile types and obstacles
- Power-up variations beyond health restoration
- Score system based on distance and collectibles
- Additional animation states
- Particle effects for key events
